		<p>Cribbage was invented by the English poet Sir John Suckling in the early 17th century.
			The earliest rules were published in England in 1662. Cribbage was also popular among prospectors
			in the American West, and to this day the small mining town of Nelson, Montana has a sign proclaiming
			it the "Cribbage Capital of the World". </p>

		<p>The players cut for first deal, and the person who cuts the lowest card deals.
			The dealer shuffles and deals five or six cards to each player, depending on
			the number of players. For two players, each is dealt six cards; for three or
			four players, each is dealt five cards. In the case of three players, a single
			card is dealt face down in the centre of the table to start the crib. Once the
			cards have been dealt, each player chooses four cards to retain, then discards
			the other one or two face-down to form the "crib" (also called the box), which
			will be used later by the dealer.<br><br>
			At this point, each player's hand and the crib will contain exactly four cards.
			The player on the dealer's left or, in a two-player game, the pone, cuts the
			remaining pack. The dealer reveals the top card of the lower half, called the
			"starter card" or "cut", and places it face up on top of the reunited pack.
			If this card is a jack, the dealer scores two points for "his heels" or "his nibs".</p>

		<p> Starting with the player on the dealer's left, the players each, in turn,
			lay one card face up on the table in front of them, stating the count—that is,
			the cumulative value of the cards that have been laid (for example, the first
			player lays a five and says "five", the next lays a six and says "eleven", and
			so on)—without the count going above 31. Face cards (kings, queens, and jacks)
			count as 10. The cards are not laid in the centre of the table as, at the end of
			the "play", each player needs to pick up the cards they have laid.<br><br>

			Players score points during the play as follows:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>15 – For causing the count to reach exactly 15 a player scores two points, then
				play continues.
			</li>
			<li>Pair – Completing a pair (two of a kind) scores two points.</li>
			<li>Three of a kind is the same as three different pairs, or 6 points.</li>
			<li>Four of a kind is 6 different pairs, or 12 points.</li>
			<li>A run of three or more cards (consecutively played, but not necessarily in order)
				scores the number of cards in the run.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			If a player cannot play without causing the count to exceed 31, they call "Go".
			Continuing with the player on their left, the other players continue the play until
			no one can play without the count exceeding 31. A player is obliged to play a card
			unless there is no card in their hand that can be played without the count exceeding
			31 (one cannot voluntarily pass). Once 31 is reached or no one is able to play, the
			player who played the last card scores one point if the count is still under 31 and
			two if it is exactly 31. The count is then reset to zero and those players with cards
			remaining in their hands repeat the process starting with the player to the left of the
			player who played the last card. When all players have played all of their cards the game
			proceeds to the "show".<br><br>

			Players choose the order in which to lay their cards in order to maximize their scores;
			experienced players refer to this as either good or poor "pegging" or "pegsmanship". If one
			player reaches the target (usually 61 or 121), the game ends immediately and that player wins.
			When the scores are level during a game, the players' pegs will be side by side, and it is
			thought that this gave rise to the phrase "level pegging"</p>

		<p>Once the play is complete, each player in turn, starting with the player on
			the left of the dealer, displays their own hand on the table and scores points
			based on its content in conjunction with the starter card. <br><br>
			Points are scored for:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Combinations of any number of cards totalling fifteen</li>
			<li>Runs</li>
			<li>Pairs (Multiple pairs are scored pair by pair but may be referred to as three or
				four of a kind.)
			</li>
			<li>Four-card flush (All four cards in the hand of the same suit score four points.)</li>
			<li>Five-card flush (All four cards in the hand of the same suit as the starter card
				score five points. A flush in the crib must be a five-card flush according to the
				official rules of the ACC.)
			</li>
			<li>Having a jack of the same suit as the starter card ("one for his nob [or nobs or nibs]",
				sometimes called the "right" jack)
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The dealer scores their hand last and then turns the cards in the crib face up. These
			cards are then scored by the dealer as an additional hand, also in conjunction with the
			starter card. Unlike the dealer's own hand, the crib cannot score a four-card flush, but
			it can score a five-card flush with the starter.<br>
			The next person begins a new round by dealing again. Play continues until a person reaches a score of
			121.
